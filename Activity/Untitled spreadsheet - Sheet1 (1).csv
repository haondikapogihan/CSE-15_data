7,"I have have gone in the last 10 years from a 2004 Miata LS to a 2006 Audi S-4 now to a 2013 128 i. Could not fit comfortably in the Miata, did not like the light steering feel and weight of the S-4, but those issues are solved with my M packaged 128i convertible MT. Purchased the car 11 months ago from a BMW dealer with 18 K on the odometer, essentially a new car. Speakers not working properly perhaps loose connections.",NEUTRAL
8,"Idk what to think yet. I need to learn about it in order to drive it, this is not your average, get in and go car. I just purchased it 2 days ago with MT 30K miles, but a lot is already falling apart inside, the stick is very hard to use, the gear shift is not smooth, I test-drove it and it was awesome, but now that I own it, not that much... I hope it will get better!",NEUTRAL
