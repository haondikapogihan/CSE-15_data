@kh7688,3 months ,Murphy has been loyal to Nolan for nearly two decades. It's about time he was given his own film. This might just be the film that gets both these men their respective Oscars. No more than they deserve. Can't wait for this.
@dixonmixin10,2 weeks  ,"As someone with pretty severe ADHD, the fact that I sat in the IMAX with rapt attention never looking away from the screen speaks volumes. A brilliant movie."
@reganmccarthy8409,3 weeks ,"I’ve never felt so glued to a screen as I did with this movie. Without a doubt my favourite movie from Nolan, and actually one of my favourite movies of all time. This was an experience to see in theatres. Absolutely incredible."
@mauientertainment4665,2 weeks ,You know a Movie is good when you come back to the Trailers.
@astha_yadav,3 weeks  ,"This film moved me to tears, the life and story of Oppenheimer, how well it was all presented, and how it all coincided at the end.
What struck me the most was the portrayal of his feelings and thoughts after the bomb was dropped. How he looked in the audience of people applauding and laughing for at least one more person to be as horrified as him. How he let them tear his life apart by pieces as to punish himself, but in the end as Einstein said ""After they have punished you enough, they will call you, award you and say all is forgiven, just remember it will all be for them, not for you."""
@tsaiyungchien1053,6 days ,"This movie really makes you feel that if you want to achieve something, you've got to be all in, focusing on the right stuff and making friends who are into the same thing"
@bigjim5423,3 months  ,"Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy, a crucial moment in humanity's history...How can this not be epic?"
@livi_2259,8 days ,"Me and my friends loved this movie. Wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't passionate about science or don't like complicated movies,that require a lot of focus to be understood. It was also pretty emotional, I started crying in the end. One of the best movies I've seen."
@lukedaley17,3 weeks ,Saw this in cinemas. As a Nolan fan I have to say this movie blew me away. The scenes running up to the atom bomb was gripping. This movie is Christopher Nolan at his very best.
@BaraMatahariPagi,2 weeks ,Amazing how almost every line in this film can be a quote of its own. Such masterful dialogue writing!
@everydayfinanceyt,4 weeks  ,My mind is blown. I think Oppenheimer was one of Nolan's best... although there are many to consider. The storytelling and acting are top-notch. It could be the best movie I've ever seen.
@solelectra,2 weeks ,"The cast, the script, the cinematography  - A MASTERPIECE. Highly recommend this movie,"
@braken8642,3 months ,Cillian's eyes staring into space transfer so much meaning and emotion.  Unbelievable actor.
@oehab.t,7 days ,"We've been sad, and my wife cried at the cinema because of this movie. It's so sad to see what people can do to other people through wars. Sending love to Christopher Nolan from Egypt."
@benmabie6069,3 weeks ,"Just watched this film in IMAX last night. One of the best movies I have ever seen and seeing it in IMAX definitely added to it. The acting was flawless and the lead up to the explosion made it feel like you were actually there during the time period. Remember people, it is supposed to be a documentary about the complex life of Oppenheimer soo it may be slow at some periods but regardless, it was fantastic!"
@RanGame,2 weeks ,"The movie was absolutely amazing, and even saying that is an understatement, and a big understatement. The music, scenes, story, everything about the movie was perfect. Christopher Nolan made a timeless masterpiece that I will always remember"
@solemnbassoon8293,3 weeks ,This may be one of the best movie I’ve ever seen. The way it was put together and the way it just changes your perspective on how life is so precious is just amazing! The silence when the bomb explodes is also horrifyingly great! Absolute Masterpiece.
@juanvillamayor3676,2 weeks ,Este actor así como toda la película se merecen los Oscars. Es una obra de arte impactante de Nolan
@JaggusBaro,1 month ,I’m rooting for Cillian’s first oscar! He truly deserves it.
@nealfager8126,12 days ,"I don't believe there is any meaning to life other than what we each give it ourselves but some moments and movies are so good they feel extremely important. 

This movie is as moving powerful and feels as important or like it was meant to be made more than almost any I've ever seen. "
@myvaulttv9045,4 weeks ,Incredible and amazing film. My man Nolan just keeps pumping out epic films. The bomb test nearly brought me tears not only because of its stunning visuals bout mostly because it made me feel like i was there and it simply took my breath away. I was sitting right next to my mom watching this masterpiece and i had to hide my tears. I cant wait for his next movie.
@nghiahuunguyen,2 weeks ,Absolutely amazing film. I tested up in some scene. Just too powerful. Nolan does what Nolan does best. SPOILER Was going seeing how Nolan plays with time. Seeing everything coming together at the end is just amazing.
@mainmanmainlining7575,3 weeks ,I’ve seen it twice now and can’t wait to go again. A briskly paced 3 hr epic that’s essentially an action chamber piece. People in rooms planning which doesn’t sound exciting but Nolan uses pure unadulterated cinema to make it one of the most exciting movies I’ve seen on the big screen in a long long time. 
@erikwestervelt6083,3 days ,Such an incredible movie that even the TRAILER is brilliant & worth rewatching. A masterclass in direction & editing!
@fk8669,3 months ,Cillian absolutely deserves to be the lead in a movie like this. Long overdue.

@rmac1828,4 weeks ,"The film was brilliant and made you cry at the same time. It's a little fast-paced at first,  then slows down as you decipher all that's going on up towards the end"
@ttom2460,2 weeks ,"Absolutely incredible. I really hope they will academy awards. The entire cast was outstanding. Probably one of the best movies from Christopher Nolan, possibly the best one."
@averagbeast3606,3 months ,Cillian Murphy is literally the perfect cast for this role. This is going to be epic!
@Mio248,3 weeks ,"I'll just say this.

That ending sequence was insane to watch on the IMAX screen. Ludwig Göransson's score (like TeneT) was outstanding in this film. Definitely making a name for himself in my ears."
@jkerfeld,10 days ,The one flick that brought me back to theatres post-covid. I can't say I've ever been glued to my seat for 3 hours...before now. May this film bathe in all the awards and be taught in film schools for decades to come.
@vanderstewart,10 days ,"Watched in IMAX this morning and my ears still hurts, and still so grateful to be able to witness a movie so brilliantly made, about such important figure in such important time in the history, a true masterpiece"
@jedhawkins1769,2 weeks  ,"Some of these actors in the movie were former child stars and teen heartthrobs, such as Michael Angarano, Josh Peck, David Krumholtz, Devon Bostick, Alex Wolff, and Josh Harnett. All of them absolutelly killed it in this film, which is one of the biggest movies in the world breaking box office records. They have all moved on from their child stardom days to the greener pastures of blockbuster epics in their adult years."
@Abhishekkumar-nn5nz,3 weeks ,If Cillian doesn't win Oscar for his acting then Oscar is totally a biased award platform. Thanks to Chris Nolan for creating such a masterpiece. Don't understand how come movie like Barbie could make a huge collection at theatres.

@amoghtare3780,10 days  ,"Just hopped in here to watch this trailer again was like 2 weeks  I watched this masterpiece on a whole big screen and obviously for me was nolan's first movie to experience on big screen never knew I would get so much intense chills even tho I didn't got to watch in imax kinda regret that but still on normal screen it was damn overwhelming as well.. every particular scene holds that deeper meaning which makes totally our mind think for every seconds especially each and every character's mind games they play over and deep serious background music in every scene is what really made it more inquisitive yeah the plot represents about history, chemistry, politics but more in a interesting way that attracts deeper attention within.. we all do imagine a lot of stuff being inside our head thoughts which creates that imagination and the way he keeps on imagining the big bang I also really felt that similarity in me coz I'm also like a thinker and one who imagines a lot all the time living inside head.. one of the most trembling scene obviously was the explosion just like ""light travels faster than sound"" wasn't able to take my eyes off from such a giant fireball everything went dead silence for seconds but when the sound blasted in felt like a heavy strike on my face just like Ali's power cross  yeah and I shooked little pulled back into layed position on seat tremendous feeling tho.. horrifying scenes as well was literally shivering and ending scene felt me with absolute mesmerism of about the calculations and chain reaction.. first time hearing the music ""can you hear the music"" lured up my mind with such a enticement that I'm still constantly obsessed with it and did felt some imagination and connection in my head through that music.. but truly I enjoyed it all.. tears, emotion, intense feeling, terror, dark reality, imagination is like what i got the actual feel from it and don't know if I could ever get this type of  feeling experience from any other movie"

@abhijeettripathy8661,3 weeks  ,If movie making is an art then Nolan is a  master... Only Nolan can make a movie which is absolutely boring into something remarkable...The pace of the movie is so fast and the music it sometimes feel like a thriller.... Both Cilian and Robert Downey Jr acting are top notch.. Last 5 minutes conversation between Einstein and openhimer is one of the finest scene in movie history... Although it's not a theatre type movie but still.... you will see the creativity of the director...

I have seen it 4 times and each time I walked out of the theatre devastated, scared, haunted and speechless. The score is one of the best in history. Haunting. The ending gave me chills. Christopher Nolan is the best film maker of the 21st century imo."

@bobhill3941,3 weeks ,"My mom and I just went to see Oppenheimer at landmark theatres and it was fantastic,, we both really enjoyed it. It was very well done and well acted and I recognized a few of the actors. To us, it was a constant suspenseful slow burn full of intrigue, showcasing the chaotic, tortured life of a very smart man who did his best to manage everything, including his personal life, working through impossible stress and impossible deadlines but coming through in the end and being hated and feeling personally conflicted. I hated how he was treated in the end, it was cruel and unfair, but I was proud that he had people fighting for him."

It actually served the uncomfortable tension of the moment far better than an MCU explosion for the 10 millionth time."
@elainegmorrison,13 days ,"I wasn't going to watch it but I enjoyed the textbook names of the physicists showing up one by one. It was a very captivating movie, considering I was dead set against a bomb-making film. The dialogue was excellent and as has been mentioned the soundtrack underlined the tension all the way through. It travelled and didn't lag for one moment. It wasn't light entertainment, nor was it particularly deep, but highly political and I suppose a tale of when politics slip into a personal battle...and for some reason this seems to be appealing. And for some reason a movie is made about someone who attempted to poison his tutor, and for that matter I was surprised there was no sarcasm about the intentional lack of apples at Los Alamos. It seemed to be the tone of the movie to skim over and summarize a fair number of items expediently."
